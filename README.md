OnlyCoders Hiring Test

This Project has two modules only_coders_BE (the Express/Node backend service) and onlycoders_FE (the NextJS/React Frontend Application)

To Spin up the backend server please follow these steps 
Please change the mongodb url in only_coders_BE/src/services/UserService Line:6 so that it will connect to your database

``` bash
$ npm i
$ npm run dev
```
To Spin up the Frontend Application please follow these steps 

``` bash
$ npm i
$ npm run dev
```

The website will be accessible at localhost:3000


PS: Since the wireframe provided was just an image, It was difficult to get the assets so I have used material ui icons in places, tried my best to get the exact color codes
